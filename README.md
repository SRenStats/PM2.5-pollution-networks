# PM2.5-pollution-networks
The primary goal of this project is to study the structure of PM2.5 air pollution data over 31 provincial capitals in China. 


Specifically, we use graphical models to build networks that indicate the relationships of air pollution in different cities, employ community detection algorithms to study the block structure of the constructed PM2.5 pollution networks, and utilize the hub structure to analyse the causal relationships of PM2.5 pollution among different cities.
## Methodologies
* Graphical models, hubs, scale-free
* Network analysis, community detection
##  What I learned
* The skills to apply advanced ststistical models to real problems
* Data collection techniques such as web scraping
* Data visualisation skills including ggplot2 and ggmap

## Note
I particated this project when I started my master. Through this project, my coding skills were improved a lot especially on data collecting, data cleaning and data visualization. Moreover, I learend that a good data visualization can provide valuable insights on the data and guide researchers to explore on more advanced models that can lead towards profund conclusions.
